------------------------------------------------------------------------

This archive contains the R code for the analysis reported in the above study. The code is presented as [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) which are documents that combine both code and the output in a form that can be viewed online, but also re-run and the results reproduced when accompanied by the original datasets.

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that report the analysis and results

1.  [Bell_et_al_StrokePsychosis_Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/vaughanbell/stroke-psychosis-national-epi-analysis/blob/main/Bell_et_al_StrokePsychosis_Analysis.ipynb) - that reports the main analysis reported in this study
2.  [Bell_et_al_StrokePsychosis_Imputation.ipynb](https://github.com/vaughanbell/stroke-psychosis-national-epi-analysis/blob/main/Bell_et_al_StrokePsychosis_Imputation.ipynb) - that reports the random forest missing data imputation results for the variables taken from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys 2001-2003 dataset
